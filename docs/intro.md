# Introduction

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), we envision a future where AI becomes a universal tool to enhance the quality of life and promote global equality of opportunity. However, currently, the control of AI technology is mainly concentrated in the hands of a few monopolistic institutions. This centralized AI platform has brought about significant issues such as privacy breaches, exacerbated economic inequality, and restricted access to resources, which greatly hinders innovation and limits the participation of developers from diverse backgrounds in the development of AI technology. Moreover, the data used for AI training has almost been exhausted, and the increasing emphasis on copyright protection further increases the difficulty of obtaining public data. Many LLMs only make their models public without revealing the weights. How to effectively and quickly utilize internal non-public data, and continuously improve the model's reasoning ability and context length under limited data conditions, remains an urgent problem to be solved. At the same time, this also puts forward higher requirements for the privacy reasoning and reasoning performance of AI models.

To address these issues, we have launched LazAI â€” a decentralized AI platform dedicated to building an open, transparent, high-performance, secure, and inclusive AI ecosystem. LazAI is an innovative framework centered around the concept of "AI assets," which is used to define the ownership and management protocols of private AI resources (such as personal data and proprietary models). On the LazAI platform, AI developers, data providers, and other stakeholders can collaborate through integrated development tools to jointly create high-quality AI assets. These assets can be used for further development or traded and shared within the platform. LazAI uses blockchain technology to ensure that all interactions are transparent and tamper-proof, with clear ownership and fair profit distribution for contributors.

## Why Alith

In LazAI, we believe that AI Agent is not a solution, but a goal we want to achieve and a problem that needs to be urgently solved. In the past 1 - 2 years, many AI Agent frameworks have emerged on the market, but they have not truly played the role of AI Agent. Restricted by the acquisition of internal data, the difficulty and cost of training and fine-tuning, as well as the high inference cost and low efficiency, AI Agents cannot be widely practiced, and the application scenarios are mostly concentrated in chatbots and so on. Therefore, we have launched the Alith AI Agent framework, which optimizes the model as much as possible on the basis of effectively utilizing data, improves the reasoning performance, and meets the needs of scene use. The Alith AI Agent framework mainly has the following characteristics:

- **Training/Inference Data Sovereignty** - Through the LazAI platform, we ensure the fair and transparent distribution of benefits from data, computing power, and model contributions through iDAO and consensus technology. The platform solves the data sovereignty issue in traditional AI platforms through community-driven data governance and incentive mechanisms, removes harmful or biased data, and at the same time, encourages more users to participate and promote the sustainable development of the platform. Through LazAI's blockchain technology, the data and interaction records of the Agent are traceable, ensuring transparency and user privacy.
- **High-Performance Inference** - Leveraging the performance advantages of Rust and fast model inference technologies, including graph optimization, model quantization compression, JIT/AOT compilation using co-processors such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, to maintain excellent performance in constantly changing scenarios.
- **Developer-Friendly** - Provides SDKs for Rust, Python, and Node.js, making it easy for different developers to access, while also providing low-code orchestration and one-click deployment and operation and maintenance functions to reduce the threshold of use.
- **Highly Scalable** - From covering internal prompts to accessing low-level APIs. Customize roles, goals, tools, operations, and behaviors while maintaining clear abstractions.
- **Ecosystem Affinity** - Integrated into the existing AI and Web3 ecosystems, enabling access to any model and any chain.

## How to Choose?

In short, if you need collaboration among different development teams and multiple Agents, and your scenario has special requirements for data acquisition, model fine-tuning, and high-performance inference, Alith will be your top choice. At the same time, Alith also provides the capability support offered by most AI Agent frameworks.
