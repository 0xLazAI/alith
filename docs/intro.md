# Introduction

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), we envision a future where AI becomes a universal tool to enhance the quality of life and promote global equality of opportunity. However, currently, the control of AI technology is mainly concentrated in the hands of a few monopolistic institutions. This centralized AI platform has brought about significant issues such as privacy breaches, exacerbated economic inequality, and restricted access to resources, which greatly hinders innovation and limits the participation of developers from diverse backgrounds in the development of AI technology. Moreover, the data used for AI training has almost been exhausted, and the increasing emphasis on copyright protection further increases the difficulty of obtaining public data. Many LLMs only make their models public without revealing the weights. How to effectively and quickly utilize internal non-public data, and continuously improve the model's reasoning ability and context length under limited data conditions, remains an urgent problem to be solved. At the same time, this also puts forward higher requirements for the privacy reasoning and reasoning performance of AI models.

To address these issues, we have launched LazAI â€” a decentralized AI platform dedicated to building an open, transparent, high-performance, secure, and inclusive AI ecosystem. LazAI is an innovative framework centered around the concept of "AI assets," which is used to define the ownership and management protocols of private AI resources (such as personal data and proprietary models). On the LazAI platform, AI developers, data providers, and other stakeholders can collaborate through integrated development tools to jointly create high-quality AI assets. These assets can be used for further development or traded and shared within the platform. LazAI uses blockchain technology to ensure that all interactions are transparent and tamper-proof, with clear ownership and fair profit distribution for contributors.

## Why Alith

In LazAI, we believe that AI Agent is not a solution, but a goal we want to achieve and a problem that needs to be urgently solved. In the past 1 - 2 years, many AI Agent frameworks have emerged on the market, but they have not truly played the role of AI Agent. Restricted by the acquisition of internal data, the difficulty and cost of training and fine-tuning, as well as the high inference cost and low efficiency, AI Agents cannot be widely practiced, and the application scenarios are mostly concentrated in chatbots and so on. Therefore, we have launched the Alith AI Agent framework, which optimizes the model as much as possible on the basis of effectively utilizing data, improves the reasoning performance, and meets the needs of scene use. The Alith AI Agent framework mainly has the following characteristics:

- **Training/Inference Data Sovereignty** - Through the LazAI platform, we ensure the fair and transparent distribution of benefits from data, computing power, and model contributions through iDAO and consensus technology. The platform solves the data sovereignty issue in traditional AI platforms through community-driven data governance and incentive mechanisms, removes harmful or biased data, and at the same time, encourages more users to participate and promote the sustainable development of the platform. Through LazAI's blockchain technology, the data and interaction records of the Agent are traceable, ensuring transparency and user privacy.
- **High-Performance Inference** - Leveraging the performance advantages of Rust and fast model inference technologies, including graph optimization, model quantization compression, JIT/AOT compilation using co-processors such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, to maintain excellent performance in constantly changing scenarios.
- **Developer-Friendly** - Provides SDKs for Rust, Python, and Node.js, making it easy for different developers to access, while also providing low-code orchestration and one-click deployment and operation and maintenance functions to reduce the threshold of use.
- **Highly Scalable** - From covering internal prompts to accessing low-level APIs. Customize roles, goals, tools, operations, and behaviors while maintaining clear abstractions.
- **AI and Web3 Ecosystem Affinity** - Integrated into the existing AI and Web3 ecosystems, enabling access to any model and any chain.

## How to Choose?

In short, if you need collaboration among different development teams and multiple Agents, and your scenario has special requirements for data acquisition, model fine-tuning, and high-performance inference, Alith will be your top choice. At the same time, Alith also provides the capability support offered by most AI Agent frameworks.

### v.s. Langchain

Langchain is a popular framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a wide range of tools and integrations for linking together different components of AI applications. However, Langchain focuses primarily on the orchestration of LLMs and lacks native support for Web3 and blockchain integration. Alith is designed specifically for Web3, providing seamless integration with blockchain technology, decentralized data governance, and high-performance inference capabilities. If your project requires Web3 integration or decentralized AI workflows, Alith is a better choice. In addition, based on the Alith Python SDK and Node SDK, we can easily integrate Alith with Langchain and Langchainjs.

### v.s. Eliza

Eliza is a lightweight AI framework designed to be simple and easy to use for Web3. It is ideal for developers who need to quickly prototype AI applications without dealing with complex configurations and workflows. Compared to Eliza, Alith has a cross-language SDK, high-performance inference, and support for complex workflows, providing a more powerful solution for developers who need to build scalable, high-performance AI agents with Web3 capabilities. In addition, based on the Alith Node SDK, we can easily combine Alith and Eliza to benefit from the Eliza Web3 ecosystem while making up for the disadvantages of the Eliza framework.

### v.s. Swarms

Swarms is another AI framework that emphasizes collaborative multi-agent systems. It allows multiple AI agents to work together to solve complex tasks. While Swarms excels in multi-agent collaboration, it does not provide the same level of Web3 integration or high-performance inference optimization as Alith, nor does it provide multi-language SDK support. Alith's focus on Web3-friendly features, combined with its Rust-based performance optimizations, makes it a more suitable choice for developers looking to build decentralized, high-performance AI agents.

### v.s. Rig

Rig is also an AI Agent framework written in Rust. Compared to Rig, Alith provides developers with easier-to-use Python and Node SDKs, and has made more inference optimizations for diffrent devices such as CPU, GPU, etc., which is more suitable for developers who need to combine real-time data processing with AI and blockchain technologies.
