# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Alith supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), a technique that enables AI models to dynamically 
integrate external services and data sources during inference. This protocol acts as a bridge 
between LLMs and various tools/APIs, allowing models to:

- Access real-time context from external systems (GitHub, databases, APIs, etc.).
- Extend capabilities without retraining by connecting to specialized tools.
- Maintain fresh knowledge through live data connections.
- Execute complex workflows via chained service integrations.

The protocol operates through lightweight server adapters defined in the configuration file. Each MCP server:

- Runs as a separate process using native runtime (Node.js/Python).
- Implements standardized interfaces for tool discovery and execution.
- Can chain multiple services through semantic routing.
- Maintains security through process isolation.

## Read MCP Servers from Config

```rust
use alith::{Agent, LLM};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    let model = LLM::from_model_name("gpt-4")?;
    let agent = Agent::new("simple agent", model)
        .preamble("You are a calculator here to help the user perform arithmetic operations. Use the tools provided to answer the user's question.")
        .mcp_config_path("servers_config.json").await?;
    let response = agent.prompt("Calculate 10 - 3").await?;
    println!("{}", response);
    Ok(())
}
```

An example of MCP config servers is as follows

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> Note: Note that most MCP servers are written in Python or Node.js, 
> you need to install the Python package manage tool `uv` and the Node.js
> package manage tool `npx`

## Read MCP Servers from Config

```python

agent = Agent(
    name="Calculator Agent",

    preamble="You are a calculator here to help the user perform arithmetic operations. Use the tools provided to answer the user's question.",
    mcp_config_path="servers_config.json",
)
print(agent.prompt("Calculate 10 - 3"))
```

                "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
